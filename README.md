# Welcome to the Arduino-TouchScreenKeypad wiki!

## Author:

# Introduction:
Uses the Seeed Studio TFT touch screen to display a numerical keypad for the Arduino Uno. Features include display box, 
numerical keypad, enter (checks password) and clear (clears password).

This is a great add-on to many of the existing Arduino projects.  For example, one could create a password controlled 
lock with this keypad.  Another ideal is someone could use this keypad to unlock a screen.

## Required Files:
The TFT library comes with the standard Arduino library.  However, you will also need the following libraries:
1. TouchScreen library (Link: https://github.com/adafruit/Touch-Screen-Library )
2. TouchScreenGeometry (see my files on Github)
3. TouchScreenStrings (see my files on Github)
4. TouchScreenButtons (see my files on Github)

## Instructions:
1. Download the zipfile.
2. Unzip the files.
3. Open the .ino file with the Arduino IDE.
4. Connect the Seeed Studio TFT Touchscreen to the Arduino Uno.
5. Uplad the .ino file to the Arduino and run.


## Bugs:
There are no known bugs at this time.  If you see any bugs, please contact me and I will do my best to resolve them.  
You may also feel free to resolve them yourself.  Just check with me before you submit any updates.

## Upgrades:
We become better programmers by always looking for ways to improve our code.  Thus, I will always look for ways to improve 
this code.  If you have any suggestions for improvement or would like to make improvements yourself, please let me know.
